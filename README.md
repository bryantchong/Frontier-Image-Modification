# Frontier-Image-Modification
made by Bryant Chong, Jonathan Halperin, and Michael Herchenroder

this project is for the WPI 2021 frontiers computer science class that would use multiple coding languages to produce a working website.
This website is designed to take images uploaded by the user in order to modify it using various methods we programmed on the website.
some examples of these methods are changing the RGB values of the image and modifying the brightness.
